### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Vaios a coder since 1998 with a passion for building and innovating. After a decade of shaping a company's core product and leading large teams, I took a leap in 2022 to forge my own path. 

Now, as an indie hacker, I'm crafting SaaS products and exploring new horizons.

Follow my journey for insights, updates, and a peek into the exciting world of tech entrepreneurship! ðŸš€
